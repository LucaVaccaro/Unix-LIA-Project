# Project Choices

## VPS Hosting Provider

Chosen VPS Provider: Lightsail

Reason for Choice:

  - Lightsail had a very simple and easy interface, making it a good choice for beginners.
  - It provides 90 day free trail for VPS hosting with good performance for projects.

Alternatives Considered:

- AWS EC2: More customizable and powerful but much more complex, not so beginner friendly.
- DigitalOcean: A good alternative with similar pricing and performance, but Lightsail's free trial and easier interface made it more appealing.

## Operating System

Chosen OS:** Debian

Reason for Choice:

  - Debian is known for its stability and security, making it good for server environments.
  - I enjoy using Debian more than other OS like Ubuntus.
  - It uses minimal resources, which is important for VPS hosting.

Alternatives Considered:

- Ubuntu: Very popular and has better community support, but I prefer Debian.
- CentOS: Was once known for stability but has become less ideal after it got rebuild of red hat enterprise linux. This impacted the stability and commpatibility.

Web Server

Chosen Web Server: Nginx

Reason for Choice:

- I have experience using Nginx.
- It’s lightweight, and easy to configure.

Alternatives Considered:

- Apache: More flexible and widely used, but heavier and not as fast in handling static files compared to Nginx.
  
Firewall

Chosen Firewall: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

Reason for Choice:
  - UFW is simple to configure and manage, making it ideal for securing the server without the complexity of more advanced firewall configurations.
  - It supports basic rules for controlling access to the server (allowing SSH and HTTP traffic).

Website Deployment

Chosen Deployment Strategy:  Webhook-based Auto-Deployment

Reason for Choice: 

- I use a index.html and style.css stored in my GitHub repository.
- I configured a webhook service that listens for changes and automatically pulls the latest changes to the VPS.
- It avoids the need to manually SSH into the server for every update.

Alternatives Considered:

- Manual Deployment via SSH: Involves logging into the VPS and pulling changes manually. While simple, it’s time-consuming.
- GitHub Actions CI/CD: A powerful alternative that integrates tightly with GitHub. However it's complex and and has a lot more steps compared to a webhook for this lightweight use.
